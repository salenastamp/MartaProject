# martahomework
This is a project to create an app to show an Atlanta resident where the closest 10 buses are to their location which uses the MARTA API.

In order to run this app, you will need a Google Maps API key that has the Distance Matrix API, the JavaScript API, and the Geocoding API enabled. 
You can create this key at https://console.developers.google.com
Once you have a key, you will need to enter it in the application.properties.
